# Bens-Mini-Project-3 : Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Your Task
Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript learnt this week.

## Use Story
* As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
* As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
* As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
* As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
* As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.
### Acceptance Criteria
* Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.
* The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

## What I Learned
Being the third week we were exposed to JavaScript.

As this was our first week using and seeing JavaScript I did not grasp the concepts straight away and needed to use the chirstmas break to really study the course work to get my head around it. Which proved to be time well spent as I am feeling much more confident.

## What Problems Did we Solve?
I created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game which included HTML and JavaScript. I also a created a professional README file from scratch.
